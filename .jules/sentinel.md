## 2024-05-23 - Custom Message Formatting XSS
**Vulnerability:** XSS vulnerability in `chatInterface.js`'s `formatMessage` function where user input was inserted into `innerHTML` without proper escaping.
**Learning:** The custom formatting logic blindly replaced markdown syntax but failed to escape HTML characters first, assuming the input was safe or that replacements were sufficient.
**Prevention:** Always escape HTML entities in user input *before* applying any custom formatting or inserting into the DOM. Use `textContent` when possible, or a dedicated sanitization library.
